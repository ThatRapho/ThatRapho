# 🌐 Hey there, I'm Raphael

A developer who enjoys turning ideas into interactive web experiences.  
I come from a full-stack background, but my passion lies in **front-end development** and **creative design** — building interfaces that feel good to use *and* look great.

### 🧩 I Work With
**React**, **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**, **Node.js**, **Figma**, and other tools that help bring ideas to life.

### 🎯 My Focus
- Designing responsive, modern web layouts  
- Writing clean, maintainable code  
- Experimenting with animations, UI polish, and creative concepts  

### 🔭 Currently Exploring
Improving my design workflow and learning more about front-end architecture and component libraries.

✨ *Always learning, always creating.*
